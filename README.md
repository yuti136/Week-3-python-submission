# Discount Calculator 🛒

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
- If the discount percentage is **20% or higher**, the discount is applied.  
- Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter the original price of an item.  
2. Then it asks for the discount percentage.  
3. It checks if the discount is **20% or more**:  
   - ✅ If yes → applies the discount.  
   - ❌ If no → keeps the original price.  
4. Finally, it prints the final price.
